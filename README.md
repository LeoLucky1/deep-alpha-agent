Stop paying $100/mo for "premium crypto signals" that are just delayed Discord bots running on old data. 

**Deep-Alpha-Agent** is a brutal, terminal-based AI researcher. It connects directly to decentralized Oracle nodes and bypasses Cloudflare captchas to scrape live, breaking news BEFORE it hits Crypto Twitter. It pulls real-time, tick-by-tick prices for **BTC, ETH, and SOL**, synthesizing everything into an actionable Long/Short Alpha Report in seconds. 

Running completely uncensored on **Gemini 2.5 Flash**, it hallucinates less and executes faster. 

No subscriptions. No massive installs. No complex Docker containers.

### ⚡ Instant Execution (Zero Setup)
Just bring your own Gemini API key and run it instantly in your terminal:

```bash
npx github:LeoLucky1/deep-alpha-agent
```

*(Node.js required)*

### 🛠️ How it Works
1.  **Direct Oracle Access**: The agent circumvents centralized APIs, utilizing decentralized edge networks to fetch live token prices.
2.  **Captcha Bypass Engine**: It utilizes advanced proxy routing to scrape sentiment from gated financial websites.
3.  **Alpha Synthesis**: Gemini 2.5 correlates the sentiment against the live price action to generate a terminal-based Trading Report.

### ⚠️ Disclaimer
This tool provides *research*, not financial advice. Code is provided AS-IS. 

**Star the repo if you make money, and let me know your craziest trades in the issues!** 🚀
